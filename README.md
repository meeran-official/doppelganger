   ```
   
   Or create manually:
   ```env
   # Gemini AI API Key (for chat functionality and TTS)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   
   # Weather API Key (for location-based weather integration)
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   
   # Firebase API Key (for future web features - moved from web/index.html)
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and run:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

### API Keys Required
