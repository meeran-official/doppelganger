The application currently has known Android build issues related to Kotlin compilation cache corruption with the `audioplayers_android` dependency. This is a common issue in Flutter projects with audio dependencies.

**Symptoms:**
- Gradle build failures with Kotlin daemon compilation errors
- Cache corruption errors in `audioplayers_android` plugin
- Build process hanging during Android compilation

**Temporary Workarounds:**
```bash
# Clean Flutter build cache
flutter clean

# Clear Gradle cache (Windows)
rmdir /s build
rmdir /s .gradle

# Reset pub dependencies
flutter pub get

# Try building with verbose output for debugging
flutter run --verbose
```

**Alternative Solutions:**
1. Use a different audio plugin temporarily
2. Build for iOS or web platform instead
3. Wait for `audioplayers_android` plugin updates
4. Use Android Studio's "Invalidate Caches and Restart"
