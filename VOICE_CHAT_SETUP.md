# Voice Chat Setup Guide 🎙️

## ✅ Current Implementation: Built-in Flutter TTS & Speech Recognition

Your Voice Chat now includes **real voice functionality**:

### **Features Added:**
- 🎤 **Real Speech-to-Text** using device capabilities
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech responses** with natural voice
- 🎯 **Smart response generation** based on voice input
- 🎨 **Enhanced UI** showing speaking/listening states
- ⚡ **Offline functionality** (no internet required for basic TTS)

### **How It Works:**
1. **Tap microphone** → Starts listening to your voice
2. **Speak naturally** → Converts speech to text
3. **AI processes** → Generates intelligent response
4. **Speaks back** → Plays audio response automatically

## 🚀 Next Level: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (Optional)

For **premium voice quality**, you can add Google Cloud TTS:

### **Setup Steps:**

#### 1. Get Google Cloud TTS API Key
```bash
# Go to Google Cloud Console
https://console.cloud.google.com/

# Enable Text-to-Speech API
# Create credentials → API Key
# Copy your API key
```

#### 2. Add API Key to Your App
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### 3. Update pubspec.yaml (already done)
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0  # ✅ Already added
  http: ^1.2.1             # ✅ Already added
```

#### 4. Use Google TTS in Voice Chat
Replace the built-in TTS with Google's premium voices by updating the voice chat page to use `GoogleTtsService`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If Speech Recognition Doesn't Work:

2. **Try on physical device** → Simulator might not support speech
3. **Ensure internet** → Initial speech recognition setup needs connection

### If TTS Doesn't Work:
1. **Check device volume** → Make sure media volume is up
2. **Test different text** → Some phrases work better than others
3. **Restart app** → Sometimes TTS engine needs refresh
